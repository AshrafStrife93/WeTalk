# WeTalk: Chatting Application

WeTalk Chatting Application will allow the users to chat with
other people. It allows the user to share information or chatting in a local network
environment. The most important part of this WeTalk Chatting Application is an
implementation of chatting using localhost server to chat with people rather than using an
online services such as Whatsapp, Telegram, WeChat etc. The user only need to run the
WeTalk server application and user required to enter the server IP Address and Port Number
of that computer host server. If the server is hosted in a dedicated server, user can replace the
IP Address with the Domain Name Server.
